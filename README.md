# Natural Language Processing Course - Second Semester 2023

This repository contains the work done for the *Natural Language Processing* course taken during the second semester of 2023. It includes both individual assignments and a major project focused on plagiarism detection.

## Structure

- **Laboratorios**: This folder includes various exercises and tasks completed throughout the course. Each task aims to develop practical skills in working with different aspects of natural language processing.

- **TP Plagio**: The main project of the course, where the objective was to detect plagiarism among a set of student assignments. The project involved identifying patterns and similarities between texts using natural language processing techniques.

## TP Plagio - Overview

The plagiarism detection project is based on analyzing textual data to identify similarities and potential cases of copied content. The approach leverages various natural language processing methods to compare the texts, using:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the project.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: The main library used to process and analyze the textual data.
